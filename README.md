# Celebal Technology Internship  

## Overview  
This repository documents my eight-week internship at Celebal Technology, where I successfully completed a structured learning program covering various technical domains. Each week included self-paced learning modules, hands-on assignments, and GitHub submissions to track my progress.  

Throughout this internship, I was guided by my mentor, who provided valuable feedback and support. Whenever I made mistakes, I carefully revised and improved my work, ensuring continuous growth and learning.  

## Internship Timeline  
The internship lasted for eight weeks in an online, self-paced format with mentor guidance. Deliverables included weekly GitHub submissions showcasing assignments, code, and documentation.  

The main focus areas were:  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Preprocessing  
- Machine Learning Models  
- Model Evaluation and Optimization  
- Deployment best practices  

## Whatâ€™s in this Repository  
This repository contains all weekly assignments completed on time, clean and well-documented code for each task, detailed READMEs for each module, version-controlled commits showcasing consistent effort, and improved code quality based on mentor feedback.  

## Key Highlights  
I completed all courses and assignments within eight weeks while maintaining high-quality code and clear documentation. I improved my work with mentor feedback whenever needed, explored advanced topics beyond the basic curriculum, demonstrated consistent commitment and timely delivery, and used GitHub as a professional portfolio to track progress.  

## Commitment Towards Learning  
This internship reflects my dedication to continuous learning and adaptability to new technologies. With the guidance of my mentor, I was able to identify mistakes early, learn from them, and deliver better, optimized solutions. Balancing multiple modules and delivering assignments within strict timelines highlights my time management, discipline, and technical growth mindset.  

## Outcome  
Through this internship, I strengthened my fundamentals in exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning model training. I learned industry-standard practices for code versioning and collaboration, improved my ability to accept feedback, fix mistakes, and grow continuously, and built a solid foundation for future data science and machine learning projects.
